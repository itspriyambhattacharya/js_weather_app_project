## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   User enters a city name and clicks the "Search" button.

2. **API Call**  
   `app.js` makes a call to the OpenWeatherMap API:

   ```js
   const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${cityVal}&units=metric&appid=<YOUR_API_KEY>`;
   const response = await fetch(url);
   ```

3. **Data Extraction**  
   Weather data is extracted and displayed using DOM manipulation:

   ```js
   tempSpan.innerHTML = data.main.temp;
   flSpan.innerHTML = data.main.feels_like;
   ```

4. **Error Handling**  
   If an invalid city is entered, the user is redirected to `failed.html` with a message and automatic return:

   ```js
   window.location.href = "./failed.html";
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itspriyambhattacharya/js_weather_app_project.git
   ```

2. **Open in your browser**
   Simply open `index.html` in a browser.

3. **Add your API key**
   Replace the `appid` value in `app.js`:

   ```js
   const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${cityVal}&units=metric&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`;
   ```
